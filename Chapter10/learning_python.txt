The open() function returns an object representing the file. Here
open(filename) returns an object representing filename.txt. Python assigns
this object to file_object, which we'll work with later in the program. 
The keyword with closes the file once access to it is no longer needed. 

rstrip() method removes, or stripes, any whitespace characters from the right side of a string. 

Reading Line by Line
Use a for loop
with open(filename) as file_object:
    for line in file_object:
        print(line)

readlines() method takes eaach line from the file and stored it in a list. 

with open(filename) as file_object:
    lines = file_object.readlines()

pi_string = ''
for line in lines:
    pi_String += line.strip()

print(pi_String)
